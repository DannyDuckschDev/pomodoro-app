# Pomodoro Timer App

This is a simple **Pomodoro Timer** built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application allows users to manage their work sessions using the Pomodoro technique, which consists of 25-minute work intervals followed by 5-minute breaks. Additionally, I have added a custom **reset button** and a **pause button** to further enhance the functionality of the app.

## Features
- **25-minute work session** countdown timer.
- **5-minute break** timer between work sessions.
- Visual and textual timer updates during the Pomodoro cycle.
- **Reset Button**: Allows users to reset the timer to the original work session time.
- **Pause Button**: Allows users to pause and resume the timer at any point.

## How it Works
The app is based on the Pomodoro technique, a time management method where users work for 25 minutes (a "Pomodoro") and then take a short break. This cycle helps improve focus and productivity.

### Functionality:
- **Start Timer**: Begins the countdown for a 25-minute Pomodoro session.
- **Pause Timer**: Pauses the countdown and can be resumed later.
- **Reset Timer**: Resets the timer back to the starting value of the current session.

## Customizations
- **Pause Button**: A custom feature that allows users to pause the timer. This was not part of the original tutorial and was added to enhance usability.
- **Reset Button**: A feature that resets the timer back to 25 minutes if it's a work session or 5 minutes for a break session.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Structure of the web application.
- **CSS**: Styling for the user interface, including the timer display and buttons.
- **JavaScript**: Core functionality for the Pomodoro timer, including the countdown logic and button actions.
